Estimate model for private mode:

```{r}
mf=formula(Trips ~ State + Month + I(Stringency/100) + I((Stringency/100)^2) + log(Population))
pm=glm(mf,data=tripsTMPS,family = quasipoisson,subset=Mode==7 )
```

How do the actual trip values compare with model-predicted values?

```{r}
private_trips_predictions <- tripsTMPS %>% 
  filter(Mode == "7") %>% 
  select(Year, Month, State, Population, Stringency, Trips) %>% 
  add_ci(pm) %>% 
  rename(Trips_hat = pred) %>% 
  mutate(residuals = Trips - Trips_hat)

private_trips_predictions
```

This is a bit troubling, as we can immediately see there are some strange things going on
with months that have "0 trips"...

How does a scatter plot look?

```{r}
private_trips_predictions %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Trips, Trips_hat)) +
  geom_point()
```

Plotting the residuals:

```{r}
private_trips_predictions %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = residuals)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=20000)
```

Print the model fit info:

```{r}
pm
```


Lets look at the first scatter plot with logs:

```{r}
private_trips_predictions %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Trips+1, Trips_hat+1), ) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10()
```

This shows much more clearly that we have a model which is producing reasonable 
predictions for most observations, but is drastically malfunctioning (specifically, overpredicting) for some
observations, namely those which have "0" trips. This is because we estimate an overall
national seasonality trend, not a state-specific seasonality trend.

Lets re-estimate the model excluding state-months for which there is no real data.

We first need to identify those state months:

```{r}
tripsTMPS %>% 
  filter(Mode == "7") %>% 
  group_by(State, Month) %>% 
  summarise(max_Trips = max(Trips), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  arrange(max_Trips)
```

We have a total of 35 state-months which have 0 trips for all years. Lets get a 
list of these, compare them with the MRIP data collection guide, and remove them
from the model:

```{r}
no_data_sms<- tripsTMPS %>% 
  filter(Mode == "7") %>% 
  group_by(State, Month) %>% 
  summarise(max_Trips = max(Trips), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  filter(max_Trips == 0) %>% 
  select(State, Month)

no_data_sms
```

This all looks right, and lines up with figure 6 [here](https://media.fisheries.noaa.gov/2021-09/MRIP-Survey-Design-and-Statistical-Methods-2021-09-15.pdf).

```{r}
data_for_new_model <- tripsTMPS %>% 
  filter(Mode == "7") %>% 
  anti_join(no_data_sms, by = c("State", "Month"))

pm_new = glm(mf,data=data_for_new_model,family = quasipoisson)
pm_new
```

Lets look at the residual plots for this new, reduced dataset and fitted model:

```{r}
private_trips_predictions_new <- data_for_new_model %>% 
  select(Year, Month, State, Population, Stringency, Trips) %>% 
  add_ci(pm_new) %>% 
  rename(Trips_hat = pred) %>% 
  mutate(residuals = Trips - Trips_hat)

private_trips_predictions_new
```

```{r}
private_trips_predictions_new %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Trips+1, Trips_hat+1), ) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10()
```

This is something of an improvement, though certainly not as good as I had hoped...

Have the main conclusions changed regarding the inverse-U shape?

```{r}
nd=data.frame(State="Florida",Month="06",
              Population=with(tripsTMPS,Population[State=="Florida" & Month=="01" & Mode==7 & Year==2020]),
              Stringency=seq(0,3000,by=50))

#Predicted trips as a function of stringency, including confidence intervals
pd=add_ci(nd,pm_new)

plot(y=pd$pred/1000000,x=pd$Stringency,type="l",ylim=c(2,5),xlim=c(3000,0),
     main="Private Boats",
     xlab="Stringency Index (Monthly sum of daily records: higher is more stringent)",
     ylab="Millions of Fishing Trips (Scaled to June 2020 in FL)")
lines(y=pd$LCB0.025/1000000,x=pd$Stringency,lty=2)
lines(y=pd$UCB0.975/1000000,x=pd$Stringency,lty=2)
abline(h=pd$pred[pd$Stringency==0]/1000000)
```

They absolutely have not! And if anything, the confidence intervals are tighter
since the model fit is improved, and so I think this is an improvement in
every way. What is particularly striking to me is that the "break-even" point for
stringency is essentially unchanged, around 2200.

What was I originally trying to do here? I seem to have gotten a bit side-tracked...

The original idea was to try and create counter-factual comparisons of how many
total trips would have occurred in each state in 2020 if there had been no COVID.
This is accomplished by taking predictions of each state-month given Stringency
equal to 0.

First lets get the annual total under the actual scenario:

```{r}
tripsTMPS %>% 
  filter(Mode == "7", Year == 2020) %>% 
  group_by(State) %>% 
  summarise(annual_trips = sum(Trips)) %>% 
  arrange(annual_trips)
```

It really is striking by what a large margin Florida has the most private boat
fishing trips of any state...

Now, to get the predicted values for each state-month, we need to create a dataframe
to which we can add the predictions:

```{r}
counterfactual_2020_w_no_COVID <- tripsTMPS %>% 
  filter(Mode == "7", Year == 2020) %>% 
  select(State, Month, Population) %>% 
  mutate(Stringency = 0) %>% 
  anti_join(no_data_sms, by = c("State", "Month"))

counterfactual_2020_w_no_COVID
```

Note that I have excluded the 0 state-months, so that I can go back in and fill those
with 0's.

Now to add the predictions:

```{r}
counterfactual_2020_w_no_COVID <- counterfactual_2020_w_no_COVID %>% 
  add_ci(pm_new)

counterfactual_2020_w_no_COVID
```

And fill in the 0's:

```{r}
counterfactual_2020_w_no_COVID <- counterfactual_2020_w_no_COVID %>% 
  complete(State, Month) %>% 
  mutate(Stringency = 0) %>% 
  group_by(State) %>% 
  fill(Population, .direction = "updown") %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  rename(Trips_hat = pred) %>% 
  mutate(Trips_hat = if_else(is.na(Trips_hat), 0, Trips_hat))

counterfactual_2020_w_no_COVID
```

Now lets compare actual trips in 2020 with the predicted trips if there had
been no COVID in 2020:

```{r}
annual_trips_2020_actual <- tripsTMPS %>% 
  filter(Mode == "7", Year == 2020) %>% 
  group_by(State) %>% 
  summarise(annual_trips = sum(Trips)) %>% 
  arrange(annual_trips)

annual_trips_2020_simulated_no_covid <- counterfactual_2020_w_no_COVID %>% 
  group_by(State) %>% 
  summarise(annual_trips_hat_no_covid = sum(Trips_hat))

annual_trips_2020_actual %>% 
  left_join(annual_trips_2020_simulated_no_covid, by = "State") %>% 
  mutate(percentage_increase_due_to_covid = 100 * (annual_trips - annual_trips_hat_no_covid) / annual_trips) %>% 
  arrange(percentage_increase_due_to_covid)
```

Here we see most states had more trips than the model predicts they would have
without COVID

I would like to look at the relationship between these percentage changes
and the trip-weighted average of the COVID stringency index for each state. My
hypothesis is that the states with higher average stringency are the ones that 
saw decreases in trips.

```{r}
twas <- tripsTMPS %>% 
  filter(Year == 2020, Mode == "7") %>% 
  group_by(State) %>% 
  summarise(trip_weighted_average_stringency = weighted.mean(Stringency, Trips)) %>% 
  arrange(trip_weighted_average_stringency)

twas
```

```{r}
annual_trips_2020_actual %>% 
  left_join(annual_trips_2020_simulated_no_covid, by = "State") %>% 
  mutate(percentage_increase_due_to_covid = 100 * (annual_trips - annual_trips_hat_no_covid) / annual_trips) %>% 
  left_join(twas, by = "State")
```

Plot:

```{r}
annual_trips_2020_actual %>% 
  left_join(annual_trips_2020_simulated_no_covid, by = "State") %>% 
  mutate(percentage_increase_due_to_covid = 100 * (annual_trips - annual_trips_hat_no_covid) / annual_trips) %>% 
  left_join(twas, by = "State") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = trip_weighted_average_stringency, y = percentage_increase_due_to_covid)) +
  geom_point()
```

How about a correlation:

```{r}
comparison_2020_df <- annual_trips_2020_actual %>% 
  left_join(annual_trips_2020_simulated_no_covid, by = "State") %>% 
  mutate(percentage_increase_due_to_covid = 100 * (annual_trips - annual_trips_hat_no_covid) / annual_trips) %>% 
  left_join(twas, by = "State")

cor(comparison_2020_df$percentage_increase_due_to_covid, comparison_2020_df$trip_weighted_average_stringency)
  
```

We could, alternately, look at the data for 2019, but with the COVID stringency
values of 2019:

```{r}
counterfactual_2019_w_COVID <- tripsTMPS %>% 
  filter(Mode == "7", Year == 2019) %>% 
  select(State, Month, Population) %>% 
  anti_join(no_data_sms, by = c("State", "Month"))

counterfactual_2019_w_COVID
```

We now want to join the 2020 Stringency values:

```{r}
counterfactual_2019_w_COVID <- tripsTMPS %>% 
  filter(Mode == "7", Year == 2020) %>% 
  select(State, Month, Stringency) %>% 
  right_join(counterfactual_2019_w_COVID, by = c("State", "Month"))

counterfactual_2019_w_COVID
```

Now we can add in the predictions from the model, and then fill the 0's:

```{r}
counterfactual_2019_w_COVID <- counterfactual_2019_w_COVID %>% 
  add_ci(pm_new) %>% 
  complete(State, Month) %>% 
  rename(Trips_hat = pred) %>% 
  mutate(Trips_hat = if_else(is.na(Trips_hat), 0, Trips_hat))

counterfactual_2019_w_COVID
```

Now to get the actual 2019 values for comparison:

```{r}
annual_trips_2019_actual <- tripsTMPS %>% 
  filter(Mode == "7", Year == 2019) %>% 
  group_by(State) %>% 
  summarise(annual_trips = sum(Trips)) %>% 
  arrange(annual_trips)

annual_trips_2019_simulated_w_covid <- counterfactual_2019_w_COVID %>% 
  group_by(State) %>% 
  summarise(annual_trips_hat_w_covid = sum(Trips_hat))

annual_trips_2019_actual %>% 
  left_join(annual_trips_2019_simulated_w_covid, by = "State") %>% 
  mutate(percentage_increase_if_covid = 100 * (annual_trips_hat_w_covid - annual_trips) / annual_trips) %>% 
  arrange(percentage_increase_if_covid)
```

The rankings of states do not seem to be especially preserved in any way...

Lets look at a scatter plot of the 2 percentage changes I have calculated:

```{r}
counterfactuals_2019 <- annual_trips_2019_actual %>% 
  left_join(annual_trips_2019_simulated_w_covid, by = "State") %>% 
  mutate(percentage_increase_if_covid = 100 * (annual_trips_hat_w_covid - annual_trips) / annual_trips) %>% 
  arrange(percentage_increase_if_covid) %>% 
  rename(annual_trips_2019 = annual_trips, 
         annual_trips_2019_hat_w_covid = annual_trips_hat_w_covid,
         percentage_increase_2019_if_covid = percentage_increase_if_covid)

counterfactuals_2020 <- annual_trips_2020_actual %>% 
  left_join(annual_trips_2020_simulated_no_covid, by = "State") %>% 
  mutate(percentage_increase_due_to_covid = 100 * (annual_trips - annual_trips_hat_no_covid) / annual_trips) %>% 
  arrange(percentage_increase_due_to_covid) %>% 
  rename(annual_trips_2020 = annual_trips, 
         annual_trips_2020_hat_no_covid = annual_trips_hat_no_covid,
         percentage_increase_2020_due_to_covid = percentage_increase_due_to_covid)

counterfactuals <- counterfactuals_2019 %>% 
  left_join(counterfactuals_2020, by = "State")

counterfactuals
```

```{r}
counterfactuals %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = percentage_increase_2019_if_covid, y = percentage_increase_2020_due_to_covid)) +
  geom_point()
```

and a correlation coefficient:

```{r}
cor(counterfactuals$percentage_increase_2019_if_covid,
    counterfactuals$percentage_increase_2020_due_to_covid)
```

And this somehow manages to be negative, which does not make sense to me...
I don't think it is worth pursuing this route any further.
