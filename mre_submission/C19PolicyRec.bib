We introduce the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), a dataset that addresses the need for continuously updated, readily usable and comparable information on policy measures. From 1 January 2020, the data capture government policies related to closure and containment, health and economic policy for more than 180 countries, plus several countries' subnational jurisdictions. Policy responses are recorded on ordinal or continuous scales for 19 policy areas, capturing variation in degree of response. We present two motivating applications of the data, highlighting patterns in the timing of policy adoption and subsequent policy easing and reimposition, and illustrating how the data can be combined with behavioural and epidemiological indicators. This database enables researchers and policymakers to explore the empirical effects of policy responses on the spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths, as well as on economic and social welfare.},

  abstract = {Fixed-effect models are widely used econometric methods. This paper presents the R package FENmlm, which is devoted to the estimation of maximum likelihood (ML) models with any number of fixed-effects. The core of the algorithm, detailed in the paper, is based on a general framework to estimate any ML model with multiple fixed effects. It also integrates a fixed-point acceleration method to hasten the convergence of the fixed-effect coefficients. The R function offers the user a simple way to estimate any of four different maximum likelihood models: Poisson, Negative Binomial, Gaussian and Logit. Illustrations with real data detail the estimation process as well as the clustering of standard-errors and the various tools to export and manage results from multiple estimations. Simulations show that the algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of computing time (often by orders of magnitude) or, in the Gaussian case, is on a par with the most efficient ones. Most interestingly, apart from the Gaussian case, the algorithm is revealed to be the only able to estimate models with many fixed-effects on a simple laptop. FENmlm is a free software and distributed under the general public license, as part of the R software project.},

  abstract = {In longitudinal panels and other regression models with unobserved effects, fixed effects estimation is often paired with cluster-robust variance estimation (CRVE) in order to account for heteroskedasticity and un-modeled dependence among the errors. CRVE is asymptotically consistent as the number of independent clusters increases, but can be biased downward for sample sizes often found in applied work, leading to hypothesis tests with overly liberal rejection rates. One solution is to use bias-reduced linearization (BRL), which corrects the CRVE so that it is unbiased under a working model, and t-tests with Satterthwaite degrees of freedom. We propose a generalization of BRL that can be applied in models with arbitrary sets of fixed effects, where the original BRL method is undefined, and describe how to apply the method when the regression is estimated after absorbing the fixed effects. We also propose a small-sample test for multiple-parameter hypotheses, which generalizes the Satterthwaite approximation for t-tests. In simulations covering a variety of study designs, we find that conventional cluster-robust Wald tests can severely under-reject while the proposed small-sample test maintains Type I error very close to nominal levels.},
