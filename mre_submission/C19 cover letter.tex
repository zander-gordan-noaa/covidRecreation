\opening{To Whom It May Concern,}

I am excited to submit my article, \emph{COVID-19 Policy Stringency and Outdoor Recreation: The Case of Resident Marine Sportfishing in the United States}, to your journal. I am an economist employed by a contracting agency called ECS, where I support the mission of the NOAA Fisheries Southeast Fisheries Science Center, where both of my coauthors work as full time staff economists. My coauthors and I feel that \emph{Scientific Reports} is a great outlet for our article given the emphasis on concise, short form scientific communications from a variety of disciplines, including environmental topics such as fisheries management, and inclusive of social scientific approaches. 

I do not have specific individuals to nominate as reviewers for this article. I will however mention that while our paper exists at the intersection of an environmental science topic (Recreational Fisheries Management) and a public health topic (COVID-19 pandemic), the background and expertise of all authors is firmly in environmental science and more specifically fisheries issues, not in public health. Furthermore, the policy relevance of the article is entirely in the domain of fisheries management, ie the article concerns lessons learned for fisheries from the pandemic and how fisheries managers might prepare for future pandemics, and does not contain lessons of relevance for public health authorities. Therefore, I would suggest that reviewers be selected with an environmental science/policy background, and specifically a fisheries background if possible.

I can confirm that I have not had any prior discussions with any member of your editorial board regarding this work.

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to working with you.

\closing{Yours sincerely, Zander Gordan}
